  [Changes]

    compatibility Policy.

  [Fixes]

  - William Carr fixed the sub_error routine teaching it yet another way Jira
    can pass error messages back.

  [Documentation]

  - Lisa Hare graciously contributed some example scripts which can be found on
    the 'examples' directory.

  - All mentions of 'JIRA' were changed to 'Jira', following the change
    Atlassian made in all of its site and documentation.

  [Changes]

  - New utility methods 'set_search_iterator' and 'next_issue' make it
    easier to iterate through large sets of issues without having to deal
    with "pagination".

  - Error messages are not presented in a consistent format. JIRA errors are
    parsed and presented in a legible way.

0.004     2013-12-14 14:54:06 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - [RT-91368] Some resource responses contain no content but specify
    a Content-Type. Those were being considered errors. Now they
    simply return undef.

  - When a resource response contains a content but doesn't specify a
    Content-Type it's an error. Previously it was returning undef.
